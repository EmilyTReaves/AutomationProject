# AutomationProject

Step 1) Learn to understand & use Gauge/Selenium/CodedUI, etc -  whatever automation tool works best for me as a mostly manual tester without coding experience (https://gauge.org/get-started.html)
Step 2) Write Automation test cases (I'm sort of getting the hang of the Command line/Powershell)
Step 3) Figure out how to connect Automation test cases/framework with the app I need to automate 
Step 4) Celebrate/drink?
