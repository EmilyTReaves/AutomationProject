# AutomationProject

Some simple automation tests using Katalon Studio. I wrote them with coded UI, which Katalon uses to create and store an object repository and test scripts (in Groovy) which can be run for playback via Selenium. Toggle into a "manual" mode where test cases/suites/projects can be written and organized in human-readable language is also a feature. API & mobile testing, as well as integrations with gitHub, JIRA, and others are also perks.

(DISCLAIMER: I don't work for, am affiliated with, or get any benefit from promoting Katalon. I'm, just a fan. Especially after spending many months searching for a transitional tool to help me learn automation testing when I knew nothing about coding or API testing. Most of what I found initially had no UI and required me to run CMD prompts when I had no code knowledge. Katalon Studio is completely different.)
