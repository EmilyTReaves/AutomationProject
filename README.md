Step 1) Trying to understand how to use Gauge as a mostly manual tester without coding experience https://gauge.org/get-started.html
Step 2) Figure out how write Gauge test cases (I'm sort of getting the hang of the Command line/Powershell)
Step 3) Figure out how to connect Gauge/test cases/framework with the in-house app I want to automate testing of
Step 4) Celebrate?
